# macos-dsstore-insight
A system behavior exploration of macOS .DS_Store files.
This is my first independent systems project as a high school student.
I explored the behavior of `.DS_Store`, a hidden file macOS uses to store folder view settings.  
- What `.DS_Store` is and how it's generated
- Terminal-based experiments to detect and delete it
- Why Finder refuses to show it
- Reflections on system design and visibility

ðŸ“Œ This is part of an ongoing series where I explore how macOS works under the hood. Coming next: .plist files and launchd.
