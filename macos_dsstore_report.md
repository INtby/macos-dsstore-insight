# macOS `.DS_Store` System Behavior Exploration

I use my MacBook Air every day, and that means macOS is the system I'm most familiar with.

while exploring OnyX — a system maintenance tool for macOS — I stumbled into the **Maintenance > Rebuilding** tab and saw an option labeled:

> “Rebuild .DS_Store files”

I'm documenting what `.DS_Store` is, how it behaves, how to observe it

Some of the questions I had were:

- What does `.DS_Store` actually do?
- When is it created or updated?
- What happens if I delete it?
- Can I make it come back? And if so, when?

## Experiment 1: Searching for `.DS_Store`

To start off, I used the following command in Terminal to search for `.DS_Store` files across my user directory:

```bash
find ~ -name ".DS_Store"
```

From this, I discovered `.DS_Store` files are basically *everywhere*:

###  Common folders:

```
/Users/lucas/Documents/.DS_Store
/Users/lucas/Desktop/暑假作业/.DS_Store
/Users/lucas/Downloads/.DS_Store
```

###  Third-party application directories:

```
/Users/lucas/Library/Application Support/Ryujinx/.../.DS_Store
/Users/lucas/Library/Application Support/Chromium/.../.DS_Store
/Users/lucas/Library/Containers/com.tencent.xinWeChat/.../.DS_Store
```

### Cloud storage folders:

```
/Users/lucas/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/.DS_Store
/Users/lucas/Library/CloudStorage/iCloudDrive-iCloudDrive/.../.DS_Store
```

some apps that *look like Finder* (like WeChat or Ryujinx internal browsers) actually trigger `.DS_Store` creation themselves.

## Experiment 2 Observation

I assumed my Desktop would have a `.DS_Store`, but to my surprise, when I searched:

```bash
find ~/Desktop -name ".DS_Store"
```

Nothing showed up. Weird.

So I started messing around to see if I could get Finder to generate one.

1. Open Finder → go to Desktop
2. Switch views (icon ↔ list)
3. Change sorting (by name, kind, tags)
4. Close and reopen folder
5. Re-run the `find` command

Still nothing. That got me thinking — maybe `.DS_Store` is *only* created when Finder actually needs to save view info?

So I created a folder called `TestFolder`, rearranged icons inside it, resized the window, etc. hope to see it in the graphical window.(maybe it will be modified)

## Experiment 3

I could clearly see `.DS_Store` files in Terminal, but even after pressing `⌘ + Shift + .`, Finder wouldn't show them.

Even worse: I tried removing the `hidden` flag with:

```bash
chflags nohidden /Users/lucas/Desktop/暑假作业/.DS_Store
killall Finder
```

Still nothing. Finder just *won't* show it.

Even using tools like Dropover or soft links (symlinks) pointed directly at`.DS_Store` — and Dropover could show it in its shelf — but when I clicked "Reveal in Finder"… Finder just selected the folder, not the file. 

try to delete them
The folder sorting and display mode have been reset.

•	 The folder will be restored to the default display (such as list view, sorted by name).

•	 Custom icon arrangement, window size or background map will be lost.

No actual files or data will be deleted.

. DS_Store is just a hidden system file. If you delete it, you will not lose your documents or pictures.

Once I open that folder with Finder, the system will automatically generate a new one. DS_Store file

- Finder *really* doesn't want users to see `.DS_Store`
- macOS uses both filesystem flags and GUI rules to hide it
- Terminal and third-party apps are the only real way to observe it

---

##  Summury ！

- It's protected and hidden by design — both through filesystem flags and Finder's GUI rules
- Terminal and tools like `find`, `ls`, and `chflags` are your best bet for observing it
- GUI tools (even good ones) like Dropover can't fully bypass macOS's Finder-level suppression

**macOS controls visibility and system behavior.**

## What's for next?

This is just the beginning of my system behavior exploration.

Coming soon:

- `.plist` files and `launchd` startup agents
